Changelog for EnsembleAnalysis.py

08/05/2019:

in calc_net_concentration:
	changed 'net_concentration' from key to atribute,
 in alignment with the PointConcentration.py script
in apply_threshold_dosage:
	new function, nearly identical to 'apply_threshold_concentration' above, but 
here a threshold total dosage, in place of a threshold peak concentration, is used.
in clear_zeros:
	new function, nearly identical to 'clear_zeros' in PointConcentration.py, but
 the varibale 'signal' is also masked. Further, since no full scale concentration exists as this
 
	point, the mask is based on the sign of net_concentration. Aditionally, masking operation is not performed on the variables, c*, full_scale concentration, and full_scale_time,
	which are 
(currently) not calculated in this script. 
in plot_puff: 
	new function, which plots time series of slected variables

08/08/2019: 

in __init__:
        added attributes ensemble_max, ensemble_mean, ensemble_var, and ensemble_std	
in get_ensemble_min:
        revised indexing algorithm, to ensure that correct minimum is written to the ensemble_min array
in get_ensemble_max: 
        new function, virtually the same as get_ensemble_min, but for maximum value of each ensemble
in get_ensemble_mean:
        new function, virtually the same as get_ensemble_min and get_ensemble_max, but for mean value of each ensemble
in get_ensemble_variance:
        new function, virtually the same as get_ensemble_min, get_ensemble_max, and get_ensemble_mean but for variance of each ensemble.
in calc_puff_statistics: 
        new function, similar to CalculatePuffStatistics in the original C program written by Anne Philip, which calculates basic statistical 
        parameters of puff variables from output of get_puffs. See Bachelor Thesis of Anne Philipp (2010) for more details. 
in plot_convergence_ensemble:
        new function, plots convergence analysis of puff data. Requires get_ensemble_mean to be called before calling function. Variable conv_step plots every conv_step ensemble numbers, 
        default configuration plots all ensemble numbers. 

08/12/2019:

in __init__:
        added attributes class_width, n_classes, class_min, class_max, class_center
in calc_n_classes:
        new function, which calculates the number of classes for each ensemble size. Similar to subsection of CalculationAndWritingFrequencyDistribution
 function from original C program
        written by Anne Philip. See Bachelor Thesis of Anne Philipp (2010) for more details. 
in calc_class_width:
        new function, which calculates the width of the classes. 
in calc_class_boundaries:
        new function, which computes the boundaries, and the center of each class, as a function
 of ensemble size and number. Requires calc_class_width to be called before calling function. 

08/13/2019:

in __init__:
        added attribute n_classes_raw, class_freq, class_freq_norm
in calc_class_width:
	odified code to also save variable n_classes raw to dictionary. Note that n_classes actually represents twice the number of classes,
 and n_classes raw represents the actual number of
        classes. This confusing convention was taken directly from Anne Philip's original C program, and may
 be changed in the future upon consultation with Bernd Leitl and/or Frank Harms;
        added multiplicative factor of 2 to class widhth, as in function mantioned above from Anne Philip's C program.  	
in calc_class_boundaries
	added error messages if n_classes is not an integer. Also changed code to iterate only to n_classes_raw instead of n_classes. This is because n_classes 
actually represents twice the
	number of classes, and n_classes raw represents the actual number of classes. This confusing convention was taken directly from Anne Philip's
 original C program, and may be simplified
	in the future upon consultation with Bernd Leitl and/or Frank Harms.    
in get_class_frequency:
	new function, which returns the number of data points inside each class. Similar to subsection of CalculationAndWritingFrequencyDistribution
 function from original C program written
	by Anne Philip. See Bachelor Thesis of Anne Philipp (2010) for more details. Requires calc_class_boundaries and calc_class_width 
to be called before calling function. 
in plot_class_statstics:
	new function, plots histogram using the class analysis for all data. Uses normalized class frequencies, and creates one
	plot for each ensemble size. Requires get_class_frequency to
	be called before calling function.

09/18/2019:

in plot_class_statistics:
        adjusted code to make sure data is properly plotted, formatted plots. Unable to specifiy title pad, presumably due to old matplotlib version.
		
09/23/2019:

in plot_convergence_ensemble:
        revisions to plot formatting, including larger figure, larger text, larger markers, and specified tickmark locations
in plot_class_statistics:
        revisions to plot formatting, specifically a larger figure size	

10/01/2019:

in __init__:
       added attributes x, y, z, scale, calibration_curve, calibration_factor,
 mass_flow_controller, ref_height, ref_length,
       scaling_factor, gas_factor, gas_name, mol_weight,
 temperature, standard_temp_K, and pressure
in ambient_conditions: new function, same as ambient_conditions in PuffConcentration.py,
 which collects ambient conditions 
       during measurement. Pressure in [Pa]!
in scaling_information: 
       new function, same as scaling_information in PuffConcentration.py,
 which collects scaling data. Units (where applicable) is [m]
in tracer_information: 
       new function, same as tracer_information in PuffConcentration.py,
 which collects tracer information. Units (where applicable) is [m].
in save2file_ms_ensemble: 
       new function, similar to save2file_ms in PuffConcentration.py, saves model scale data to file, for (among other things),

       plotting the data in Tecplot. Generates a total of 2 different txt files, for convergence analysis data and class data.
       Note that data here is dimensional. 

10/04/2019:

in save2file_ms_ensemble:
       added proper labeling of rows and columns in txt files to make them more readable.	
	   
10/07/2019:

in save2file_ms_ensemble:
       removed nan values, since these won't load properly in tecplot.	

01/28/2020:

in plot_convergence_ensemble:
       added support for non-dimensional data
in plot_class_statistics:
       added support for non-dimensional data

02/21/2020:

in __init__:
       added attributes x_source, y_source, z_source, x_measure, y_measure, z_measure, and distance.
in ambient_conditions:
       added handling of variables for source and measurement locations, added calcuation of distance variable (from calc_puff_statistics function)
in calc_puff_statistics:
       added handling of variables for source and measurement locations, moved calculation of distance variable to ambient_conditions function   
in save2file_ms_ensemble:
       added handling of variables for source and measurement locations, added recording of distance variable

02/25/2020:

in save2file_ms_ensemble:
       added compatability with tecplot	 
in save2file_fs_ensemble:
       new function, similar to save2file_ms_ensemble, but for full scale data.   
in save2file_nd_ensemble:
       new function, similar to save2file_ms_ensemble and save2file_fs_ensemble, but for non-dimensional data.
